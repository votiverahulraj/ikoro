        <h1 class="section-title">What we provide</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">

            iKORO is a platform where content creators, skilled videographers, and drone pilots get orders from users

            for live video services. Creators are affiliated with iKORO to offer interactive live video services to

            users. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase definite creative video services or have a

            direct, confidential discussion with any of our creators. Although some of these methods involve iKORO

            processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, iKORO is simply the intermediary in such

            transactions. Any Host-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the

            host you speak with not between you and iKORO. Furthermore, you understand that iKORO cannot be held

            responsible for the quality or accuracy of any service provided by the host you connect with via iKORO. But,

            in all process iKORO will ensure excellence and protect users against poor services.

        <p class="paragraph">Notwithstanding any of these Terms, iKORO reserves the right, without notice and in its

            sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and

            use of the Services. iKORO reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the

            event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any

            data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">No third beneficiary rights</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and iKORO with respect to the

            subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create

            no third party beneficiary rights.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Waiver, Severability, and Assignment </h1>

        <p class="paragraph">iKORO's failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so

            later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will

            remain in full effect and an enforceable term or terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely

            as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void.

            iKORO may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any

            business associated with the Services.</p>
