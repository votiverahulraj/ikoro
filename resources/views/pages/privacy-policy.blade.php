        <p class="paragraph">Subject to certain additional rights of Nigeria users as set forth in our [Additional
            Nigeria Privacy Disclosures], other additional rights of EEA members under the GDPR, and other relevant
            regulations, we will keep your personal information only as long as necessary to provide you with the
            services available on the iKORO platform and for our legitimate and essential business purposes. These
            legitimate and essential business purposes are the same as the ones we listed for users in the EEA and
            California (please see “Right to Delete Request in our [Additional California Privacy Disclosures], and
            Erasure above).</p>

        <p class="pragraph sub-para">Deletion</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If you close or request that we close your account, we'll delete, or de identify or
            anonymize your personal data so it no longer identifies you, unless we're required to keep something or we
            still need to use it for a legally justifiable reason.

            Here are some examples of situations where we're legally allowed or required to keep some of your personal
            data:

        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>if there's an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit or unresolved
                claim or dispute</li>

            <li>for our legal, tax, audit and accounting obligations</li>

            <li>for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain security. For more, please
                see Erasure above.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="pargraph">In some cases, we will DE identify or anonymize your personal information in order to
            prevent fraud or determine whether you are a former user if you decide to re-register on the Acquire
            platform for fraud prevention purposes.</p>

        <p class="paragraph sub-para">Data Security</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental
            loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

            confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
